# ðŸ“„ Document Classifier API

This backend is a **FastAPI** application that processes PDF documents, classifies them into 6 categories, extracts text (with OCR fallback), and generates both a **summary** and a detailed **analysis** using OpenAI GPT.  

The results are stored in a **SQLite database** and can be accessed via REST API endpoints.
